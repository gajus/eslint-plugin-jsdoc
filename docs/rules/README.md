# Rules

No rules are enabled by default. Add `plugin:jsdoc/recommended` to `extends` in ESLint configuration file to enable rules that report common problems, which have a check mark :heavy_check_mark: below.

Problems reported by rules which have a wrench :wrench: below can be fixed automatically by running ESLint on the command line with `--fix` option.
