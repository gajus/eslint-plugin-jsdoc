### `valid-types`

Requires all types to be valid JSDoc or Closure compiler types without syntax errors.

Also impacts behaviors on namepath (or event)-defining and pointing tags:

1. Name(path)-defining tags requiring namepath: `@external`, `@host`, `@name`, `@typedef`
1. Name(path)-defining tags (which may have value without namepath or their
    namepath can be expressed elsewhere on the block): `@event`, `@callback`,
    `@class`, `@constructor`, `@constant`, `@const`,
    `@function`, `@func`, `@method`, `@interface`, `@member`, `@var`,
    `@mixin`, `@namespace`
1. Name(path)-pointing tags requiring namepath: `@alias`, `@augments`, `@extends`, `@lends`, `@memberof`, `@memberof!`, `@mixes`, `@this`
1. Name(path)-pointing tags (which may have value without namepath or their
    namepath can be expressed elsewhere on the block): `@listens`, `@fires`,
    `@emits`, and `@modifies`
1. Name(path)-pointing tags (multiple names in one): `@borrows`

...with the following applying to the above sets:

- Expect tags in set 1-4 to have a valid namepath if present
- Prevent sets 2 and 4 from being empty by setting `allowEmptyNamepaths` to
  `false` as these tags might have some indicative value without a path
  or may allow a name expressed elsewhere on the block (but sets 1 and 3 will
  always fail if empty)
- For the special case of set 5, i.e., `@borrows <that namepath> as <this namepath>`,
  check that both namepaths are present and valid and ensure there is an `as `
  between them. In the case of `<this namepath>`, it can be preceded by
  one of the name path operators, `#`, `.`, or `~`.
- For the special case of `@memberof` and `@memberof!` (part of set 3), as
   per the [specification](https://jsdoc.app/tags-memberof.html), they also
   allow `#`, `.`, or `~` at the end (which is not allowed at the end of
   normal paths).

#### Options

- `allowEmptyNamepaths` (default: true) - Set to `false` to disallow
  empty name paths with `@callback`, `@event`, `@class`, `@constructor`,
  `@constant`, `@const`, `@function`, `@func`, `@method`, `@interface`,
  `@member`, `@var`, `@mixin`, `@namespace`, `@listens`, `@fires`,
  `@modifies`, or `@emits` (these might often be expected to have an
  accompanying name path, though they have some indicative value without
  one; these may also allow names to be defined in another manner elsewhere
  in the block)
- `checkSeesForNamepaths` (default: false) - Set this to `true` to insist
  that `@see` only use name paths (the tag is normally permitted to
  allow other text)
