### `valid-types`

Requires all types to be valid JSDoc, Closure, or TypeScript compiler types
without syntax errors. Note that what determines a valid type is handled by
our type parsing engine, [jsdoctypeparser](https://github.com/jsdoctypeparser/jsdoctypeparser),
using [`settings.jsdoc.mode`](#eslint-plugin-jsdoc-settings-mode) to
determine whether to use jsdoctypeparser's "permissive" mode or the stricter
"jsdoc", "typescript", "closure" modes.

The following tags have their "type" portions (the segment within brackets)
checked (though those portions may sometimes be confined to namepaths,
e.g., `@modifies`):

1. Tags with required types: `@type`, `@implements`
1. Tags with required types in Closure or TypeScript: `@this`,
    `@define` (Closure only)
1. Tags with optional types: `@enum`, `@member` (`@var`), `@typedef`,
  `@augments` (or `@extends`), `@class` (or `@constructor`), `@constant`
  (or `@const`), `@module` (module paths are not planned for TypeScript),
  `@namespace`, `@throws`, `@exception`, `@yields` (or `@yield`),
  `@modifies` (undocumented jsdoc); `@param` (`@arg`, `@argument`),
  `@property` (`@prop`), and `@returns` (`@return`) also fall into this
  category, but while this rule will check their type validity, we leave
  the requiring of the type portion to the rules `require-param-type`,
  `require-property-type`, and `require-returns-type`, respectively.
1. Tags with types that are available optionally in Closure: `@export`,
    `@package`, `@private`, `@protected`, `@public`, `@static`;
    `@template` (TypeScript also)
1. Tags with optional types that may take free text instead: `@throws`

The following tags have their name/namepath portion (the non-whitespace
text after the tag name) checked:

1. Name(path)-defining tags requiring namepath: `@external`, `@host`,
    `@name`, `@typedef`, and `@template` (TypeScript/Closure only);
    `@param` (`@arg`, `@argument`) and `@property`
    (`@prop`) also fall into this category, but while this rule will check
    their namepath validity, we leave the requiring of the name portion
    to the rules `require-param-name` and `require-property-name`,
    respectively.
1. Name(path)-defining tags (which may have value without namepath or their
    namepath can be expressed elsewhere on the block): `@event`, `@callback`,
    `@class`, `@constructor`, `@constant`, `@const`, `@function`, `@func`,
    `@method`, `@interface` (TypeScript tag only), `@member`, `@var`,
    `@mixin`, `@namespace`, `@module` (module paths are not planned for
    TypeScript)
1. Name(path)-pointing tags requiring namepath: `@alias`, `@augments`,
    `@extends`, `@lends`, `@memberof`, `@memberof!`, `@mixes`, `@this`
    (jsdoc only)
1. Name(path)-pointing tags (which may have value without namepath or their
    namepath can be expressed elsewhere on the block): `@listens`, `@fires`,
    `@emits`.
1. Name(path)-pointing tags which may have free text or a namepath: `@see`
1. Name(path)-pointing tags (multiple names in one): `@borrows`

...with the following applying to the above sets:

- Expect tags in set 1-4 to have a valid namepath if present
- Prevent sets 2 and 4 from being empty by setting `allowEmptyNamepaths` to
  `false` as these tags might have some indicative value without a path
  or may allow a name expressed elsewhere on the block (but sets 1 and 3 will
  always fail if empty)
- For the special case of set 6, i.e.,
  `@borrows <that namepath> as <this namepath>`,
  check that both namepaths are present and valid and ensure there is an `as `
  between them. In the case of `<this namepath>`, it can be preceded by
  one of the name path operators, `#`, `.`, or `~`.
- For the special case of `@memberof` and `@memberof!` (part of set 3), as
   per the [specification](https://jsdoc.app/tags-memberof.html), they also
   allow `#`, `.`, or `~` at the end (which is not allowed at the end of
   normal paths).

#### Options

- `allowEmptyNamepaths` (default: true) - Set to `false` to bulk disallow
  empty name paths with namepath groups 2 and 4 (these might often be
  expected to have an accompanying name path, though they have some
  indicative value without one; these may also allow names to be defined
  in another manner elsewhere in the block)
- `checkSeesForNamepaths` (default: false) - Set this to `true` to insist
  that `@see` only use name paths (the tag is normally permitted to
  allow other text)
