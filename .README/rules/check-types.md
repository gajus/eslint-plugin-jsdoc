# `check-types`

{"gitdown": "contents", "rootId": "check-types"}

Reports invalid types.

By default, ensures that the casing of native types is the same as in this
list:

```
undefined
null
boolean
number
bigint
string
symbol
object (For TypeScript's sake, however, using `Object` when specifying child types on it like `Object<string, number>`)
Array
Function
Date
RegExp
```

## Options

{"gitdown": "options"}

## Why not capital case everything?

Why are `boolean`, `number` and `string` exempt from starting with a capital
letter? Let's take `string` as an example. In Javascript, everything is an
object. The `String` object has prototypes for string functions such as
`.toUpperCase()`.

Fortunately we don't have to write `new String()` everywhere in our code.
Javascript will automatically wrap string primitives into string Objects when
we're applying a string function to a string primitive. This way the memory
footprint is a tiny little bit smaller, and the
[GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) has
less work to do.

So in a sense, there are two types of strings in Javascript:
1. `{string}` literals, also called primitives
2. `{String}` Objects.

We use the primitives because it's easier to write and uses less memory.
`{String}` and `{string}` are technically both valid, but they are not the same.

```js
new String('lard') // String {0: "l", 1: "a", 2: "r", 3: "d", length: 4}
'lard' // "lard"
new String('lard') === 'lard' // false
```

To make things more confusing, there are also object literals (like `{}`) and
`Object` objects. But object literals are still static `Object`s and `Object`
objects are instantiated objects. So an object primitive is still an `Object`
object.

However, `Object.create(null)` objects are not `instanceof Object`, however, so
in the case of such a plain object we lower-case to indicate possible support
for these objects. Also, nowadays, TypeScript also [discourages](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html#:~:text=%E2%9D%8C%20Don't%20ever%20use,used%20appropriately%20in%20JavaScript%20code.)
use of `Object`
as a lone type. However, one additional complexity is that TypeScript allows and
actually [currently requires](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/20555)
`Object` (with the initial upper-case) if used in the syntax
`Object.<keyType, valueType>` or `Object<keyType, valueType`, perhaps to
adhere to that which [JSDoc documents](https://jsdoc.app/tags-type.html).

So, for optimal compatibility with TypeScript (especially since TypeScript
tools can be used on plain JavaScript with JSDoc), we are now requiring this
TypeScript approach by default in non-"typescript" mode (if you set
`object` type `preferredTypes` in TypeScript mode, the defaults will
not apply).

However, for "typescript" mode, a still better choice existsâ€”using index signatures such as `{[key: string]: string}` or using a more precise
shorthand object syntax (e.g., `{a: string, b: number}`). This is superior
for TypeScript because the likes of `Object<string, number>` is not useable
in native TypeScript syntax, even if it is allowed within JSDoc.

Basically, for primitives, we want to define the type as a primitive, because
that's what we use in 99.9% of cases. For everything else, we use the type
rather than the primitive. Otherwise it would all just be `{object}` (with the
additional exception of the special case of `Object.<>` just mentioned).

In short: It's not about consistency, rather about the 99.9% use case. (And
some functions might not even support the objects if they are checking for
identity.)

## Comparisons

type name | `typeof` | check-types | testcase
--|--|--|--
**Array** | object | **Array** | `([]) instanceof Array` -> `true`
**Function** | function | **Function** | `(function f () {}) instanceof Function` -> `true`
**Date** | object | **Date** | `(new Date()) instanceof Date` -> `true`
**RegExp** | object | **RegExp** | `(new RegExp(/.+/)) instanceof RegExp` -> `true`
Object | **object** | **object** | `({}) instanceof Object` -> `true` but `Object.create(null) instanceof Object` -> `false`
Boolean | **boolean** | **boolean** | `(true) instanceof Boolean` -> **`false`**
Number | **number** | **number** | `(41) instanceof Number` -> **`false`**
String | **string** | **string** | `("test") instanceof String` -> **`false`**

If you define your own tags and don't wish their bracketed portions checked
for types, you can use `settings.jsdoc.structuredTags` with a tag `type` of
`false`. If you set their `type` to an array, only those values will be
permitted.

## Fixer

Replaces native types with standard casing and replaces according to
`preferredTypes` settings.
