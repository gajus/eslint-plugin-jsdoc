### `check-types`

Reports invalid types.

By default, ensures that the casing of native types is the same as in this list:

```
undefined
null
boolean
number
bigint
string
symbol
object
Array
Function
Date
RegExp
```

#### Options

`check-types` allows one option:

- An option object:
  - with the key `noDefaults` to insist that only the supplied option type
    map is to be used, and that the default preferences (such as "string"
    over "String") will not be enforced. The option's default is `false`.
  - with the key `exemptTagContexts` which will avoid reporting when a
    bad type is found on a specified tag. Set to an array of objects with
    a key `tag` set to the tag to exempt, and a `types` key which can
    either be `true` to indicate that any types on that tag will be allowed,
    or to an array of strings which will only allow specific bad types.
    If an array of strings is given, these must match the type exactly,
    e.g., if you only allow `"object"`, it will not allow
    `"object<string, string>"`. Note that this is different from the
    behavior of `settings.jsdoc.preferredTypes`. This option is useful
    for normally restricting generic types like `object` with
    `preferredTypes`, but allowing `typedef` to indicate that its base
    type is `object`.
  - with the key `unifyParentAndChildTypeChecks` which will treat
    `settings.jsdoc.preferredTypes` keys such as `SomeType` as matching
    not only child types such as an unadorned `SomeType` but also
    `SomeType<aChildType>`, `SomeType.<aChildType>`, or if `SomeType` is
    `Array` (or `[]`), it will match `aChildType[]`. If this is `false` or
    unset, the former format will only apply to types which are not parent
    types/unions whereas the latter formats will only apply for parent
    types/unions. The special types `[]`, `.<>` (or `.`), and `<>`
    act only as parent types (and will not match a bare child type such as
    `Array` even when unified, though, as mentioned, `Array` will match
    say `string[]` or `Array.<string>` when unified). The special type
    `*` is only a child type. Note that there is no detection of parent
    and child type together, e.g., you cannot specify preferences for
    `string[]` specifically as distinct from say `number[]`, but you can
    target both with `[]` or the child types `number` or `string`.

See also the documentation on `settings.jsdoc.preferredTypes` which impacts
the behavior of `check-types`.

#### Why not capital case everything?

Why are `boolean`, `number` and `string` exempt from starting with a capital letter? Let's take `string` as an example. In Javascript, everything is an object. The string Object has prototypes for string functions such as `.toUpperCase()`.

Fortunately we don't have to write `new String()` everywhere in our code. Javascript will automatically wrap string primitives into string Objects when we're applying a string function to a string primitive. This way the memory footprint is a tiny little bit smaller, and the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) has less work to do.

So in a sense, there two types of strings in Javascript; `{string}` literals, also called primitives and `{String}` Objects. We use the primitives because it's easier to write and uses less memory. `{String}` and `{string}` are technically both valid, but they are not the same.

```js
new String('lard') // String {0: "l", 1: "a", 2: "r", 3: "d", length: 4}
'lard' // "lard"
new String('lard') === 'lard' // false
```

To make things more confusing, there are also object literals and object Objects. But object literals are still static Objects and object Objects are instantiated Objects. So an object primitive is still an object Object.

However, `Object.create(null)` objects are not `instanceof Object`, however, so
in the case of this Object we lower-case to indicate possible support for
these objects.

Basically, for primitives, we want to define the type as a primitive, because that's what we use in 99.9% of cases. For everything else, we use the type rather than the primitive. Otherwise it would all just be `{object}`.

In short: It's not about consistency, rather about the 99.9% use case. (And some
functions might not even support the objects if they are checking for identity.)

type name | `typeof` | check-types | testcase
