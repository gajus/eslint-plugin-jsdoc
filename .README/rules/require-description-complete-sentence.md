### `require-description-complete-sentence`

Requires that block description, explicit `@description`, and `@param`/`@returns`
tag descriptions are written in complete sentences, i.e.,

* Description must start with an uppercase alphabetical character.
* Paragraphs must start with an uppercase alphabetical character.
* Sentences must end with a period.
* Every line in a paragraph (except the first) which starts with an uppercase
  character must be preceded by a line ending with a period.

#### Options

##### `tags`

If you want additional tags to be checked for their descriptions, you may
add them within this option.

```js
{
  'jsdoc/require-description-complete-sentence': ['error', {tags: ['see', 'copyright']}]
}
```

The tags `@param`/`@arg`/`@argument` and `@property`/`@prop` will be properly
parsed to ensure that the checked "description" text includes only the text
after the name.

All other tags will treat the text following the tag name, a space, and
an optional curly-bracketed type expression (and another space) as part of
its "description" (e.g., for `@returns {someType} some description`, the
description is `some description` while for `@some-tag xyz`, the description
is `xyz`).
