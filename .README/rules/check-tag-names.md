# `check-tag-names`

{"gitdown": "contents"}

Reports invalid block tag names.

Valid [JSDoc 3 Block Tags](https://jsdoc.app/#block-tags) are:

```

classdesc
constant
constructs

enum
event

private
property
protected
public
readonly
requires
returns
see
since
static
summary
this
throws
todo
tutorial
type
typedef
variation
version
yields
```

`modifies` is also supported (see [source](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc/blob/master/packages/jsdoc/lib/jsdoc/tag/dictionary/definitions.js#L594)) but is undocumented.

The following synonyms are also recognized:

```
arg
argument
const
constructor
defaultvalue
desc
emits
exception
extends
fileoverview
func
host
method
overview
prop
return
var
virtual
yield
```

For [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-checking-javascript-files.html#supported-jsdoc)
(or Closure), when `settings.jsdoc.mode` is set to `typescript` or `closure`,
one may also use the following:

```
template
```

And for [Closure](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler),
when `settings.jsdoc.mode` is set to `closure`, one may use the following (in
addition to the jsdoc and TypeScript tags):

```
define (synonym of `const` per jsdoc source)
dict
export
externs
final
implicitCast (casing distinct from that recognized by jsdoc internally)
inheritDoc (casing distinct from that recognized by jsdoc internally)
noalias
nocollapse
nocompile
noinline
nosideeffects
polymer
polymerBehavior
preserve
record (synonym of `interface` per jsdoc source)
struct
suppress
unrestricted
```

...and these undocumented tags which are only in [source](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/parsing/Annotation.java):

```
closurePrimitive
customElement
expose
hidden
idGenerator
meaning
mixinClass
mixinFunction
ngInject
owner
typeSummary
wizaction
```

Note that the tags indicated as replacements in `settings.jsdoc.tagNamePreference` will automatically be considered as valid.
