### `require-returns-check`

Requires a return statement in function body if a `@returns` tag is specified
in jsdoc comment.

Will also report if multiple `@returns` tags are present.

#### Options

- `exemptAsync` - By default, functions which return a `Promise` that are not
    detected as resolving with a non-`undefined` value and `async` functions
    (even ones that do not explicitly return a value, as these are returning a
    `Promise` implicitly) will be exempted from reporting by this rule.
    If you wish to insist that only `Promise`'s which resolve to
    non-`undefined` values or `async` functions with explicit `return`'s will
    be exempted from reporting (i.e., that `async` functions can be reported
    if they lack an explicit (non-`undefined`) `return` when a `@returns` is
    present), you can set `exemptAsync` to `false` on the options object.
    Defaults to `true`.
