# `require-file-overview`

{"gitdown": "contents", "rootId": "require-file-overview"}

Checks that:

1. All files have a `@file`, `@fileoverview`, or `@overview` tag.
2. Duplicate file overview tags within a given file will be reported
3. File overview tags will be reported which are not, as per
  [the docs](https://jsdoc.app/tags-file.html), "at the beginning of
  the file"â€“where beginning of the file is interpreted in this rule
  as being when the overview tag is not preceded by anything other than
  a comment.

## Options

### `tags`

The keys of this object are tag names, and the values are configuration
objects indicating what will be checked for these whole-file tags.

Each configuration object has the following boolean keys (which default
to `false` when this option is supplied): `mustExist`, `preventDuplicates`,
`initialCommentsOnly`. These correspond to the three items above.

When no `tags` is present, the default is:

```json
{
  "file": {
    "initialCommentsOnly": true,
    "mustExist": true,
    "preventDuplicates": true,
  }
}
```

You can add additional tag names and/or override `file` if you supply this
option, e.g., in place of or in addition to `file`, giving other potential
file global tags like `@license`, `@copyright`, `@author`, `@module` or
`@exports`, optionally restricting them to a single use or preventing them
from being preceded by anything besides comments.

For example:

```js
{
  "license": {
    "mustExist": true,
    "preventDuplicates": true,
  }
}
```

This would require one and only one `@license` in the file, though because
`initialCommentsOnly` is absent and defaults to `false`, the `@license`
can be anywhere.

In the case of `@license`, you can use this rule along with the
`check-values` rule (with its `allowedLicenses` or `licensePattern` options),
to enforce a license whitelist be present on every JS file.

Note that if you choose to use `preventDuplicates` with `license`, you still
have a way to allow multiple licenses for the whole page by using the SPDX
"AND" expression, e.g., `@license (MIT AND GPL-3.0)`.

Note that the tag names are the main jsdoc tag name, so you should use `file`
in this configuration object regardless of whether you have configured
`fileoverview` instead of `file` on `tagNamePreference` (i.e., `fileoverview`
will be checked, but you must use `file` on the configuration object).
