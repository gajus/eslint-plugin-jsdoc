### `no-undefined-types`

Checks that types in jsdoc comments are defined. This can be used to check
unimported types.

When enabling this rule, types in jsdoc comments will resolve as used
variables, i.e. will not be marked as unused by `no-unused-vars`.

In addition to considering globals found in code (or in ESLint-indicated
`globals`) as defined, the following tags will also be checked for
name(path) definitions to also serve as a potential "type" for checking
the tag types in the table below:

`@callback`, `@class` (or `@constructor`), `@constant` (or `@const`), `@event`, `@external` (or `@host`), `@function` (or `@func` or `@method`), `@interface`, `@member` (or `@var`), `@mixin`, `@name`, `@namespace`, `@template` (for Closure/TypeScript), `@typedef`.

The following tags will also be checked but only when the mode is `closure`:

`@package`, `@private`, `@protected`, `@public`, `@static`

The following types are always considered defined.

- `null`, `undefined`, `void`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `function`
- `number`, `NaN`, `Infinity`
- `any`, `*`
- `Array`, `Object`, `RegExp`, `Date`, `Function`

Note that preferred types indicated within `settings.jsdoc.preferredTypes` will
also be assumed to be defined.

#### Options

An option object may have the following key:

- `definedTypes` - This array can be populated to indicate other types which
  are automatically considered as defined (in addition to globals, etc.).
  Defaults to an empty array.
