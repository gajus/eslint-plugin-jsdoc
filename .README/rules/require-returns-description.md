### `require-returns-description`

Requires that the `@returns` tag has a `description` value. The error
will not be reported if the return value is `void` or `undefined`
or if it is `Promise<void>` or `Promise<undefined>`.

#### Options

Accepts one optional options object with the following optional keys.

##### `publicOnly`

This option will insist that missing jsdoc blocks are only reported for
function bodies / class declarations that are exported from the module.
For more information see the documentation of `require-jsdoc`.

##### `contexts`

Set this to an array of strings representing the AST context (or an object with
`context` and `comment` properties) where you wish the rule to be applied.
Overrides the default contexts (see below). Set to `"any"` if you want
the rule to apply to any jsdoc block throughout your files (as is necessary
for finding function blocks not attached to a function declaration or
expression, i.e., `@callback` or `@function` (or its aliases `@func` or
`@method`) (including those associated with an `@interface`).

See the ["AST and Selectors"](#eslint-plugin-jsdoc-advanced-ast-and-selectors)
section of our README for more on the expected format.
