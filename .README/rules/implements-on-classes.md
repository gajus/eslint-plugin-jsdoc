### `implements-on-classes`

Reports an issue with any non-constructor function using `@implements`.

Constructor functions, whether marked with `@class`, `@constructs`, or being
an ES6 class constructor, will not be flagged.

To indicate that a function follows another function's signature, one might
instead use `@type` to indicate the `@function` or `@callback` to which the
function is adhering.

#### Options

##### `contexts`

Set this to an array of strings representing the AST context (or an object with
`context` and `comment` properties) where you wish the rule to be applied.

Overrides the default contexts (see below). Set to `"any"` if you want
the rule to apply to any jsdoc block throughout your files (as is necessary
for finding function blocks not attached to a function declaration or
expression, i.e., `@callback` or `@function` (or its aliases `@func` or
`@method`) (including those associated with an `@interface`).

See the ["AST and Selectors"](../#advanced-ast-and-selectors)
section of our README for more on the expected format.
