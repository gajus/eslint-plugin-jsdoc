# `require-throws`

{"gitdown": "contents", "rootId": "require-throws"}

Requires that throw statements are documented.

Note that since throw statements within async functions end up as rejected
Promises, they are not considered as throw statements for the purposes of this
rule. See [issue 755](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/755)
for our desire for a separate tag to document rejection types and see
[this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50071115/typescript-promise-rejection-type)
on why TypeScript doesn't offer such a feature.

## Options

- `exemptedBy` - Array of tags (e.g., `['type']`) whose presence on the
    document block avoids the need for a `@throws`. Defaults to an array
    with `inheritdoc`. If you set this array, it will overwrite the default,
    so be sure to add back `inheritdoc` if you wish its presence to cause
    exemption of the rule.
- `contexts` - Set this to an array of strings representing the AST context
    (or an object with `context` and `comment` properties) where you wish
    the rule to be applied.
    Overrides the default contexts (see below). Set to `"any"` if you want
    the rule to apply to any jsdoc block throughout your files (as is necessary
    for finding function blocks not attached to a function declaration or
    expression, i.e., `@callback` or `@function` (or its aliases `@func` or
    `@method`) (including those associated with an `@interface`).

```js
'jsdoc/require-throws': 'error',
```
