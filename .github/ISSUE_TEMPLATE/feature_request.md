a new issue: https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues

NOTE 2: If this is a feature specifically related to the parsing of types, e.g.,
supporting `some-new+type-syntax` (within curly brackets) in:

/**
 * @param {some-new+type-syntax} myName
 */

...then please file instead at https://github.com/simonseyock/jsdoc-type-pratt-parser/issues/
