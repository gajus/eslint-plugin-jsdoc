# `no-types`

## Introduction

This rule reports types being used on `@param` or `@returns`.

The rule is intended to prevent the indication of types on tags where
the type information would be redundant with TypeScript.

## Fixer

Strips the type.

## Options

### `contexts`

Set this to an array of strings representing the AST context (or an object with
`context` and `comment` properties) where you wish the rule to be applied.
Overrides the default contexts (see below). Set to `"any"` if you want
the rule to apply to any jsdoc block throughout your files (as is necessary
for finding function blocks not attached to a function declaration or
expression, i.e., `@callback` or `@function` (or its aliases `@func` or
`@method`) (including those associated with an `@interface`).

See the ["AST and Selectors"](../#advanced-ast-and-selectors)
section of our README for more on the expected format.
